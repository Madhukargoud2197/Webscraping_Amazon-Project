# Webscraping_Amazon-Project
In this repository i have performed web scraping, Starting with creating an csv file, pulling the data from the amazon website for a product, prettified the data, and automated the process to get appended for each iteration. Also defined an function which will send a mail when certain requirements of the product price is met.
